# Installation

SpeedDate can be used in three forms: If you are comfortable downloading your
own julia packages, there is a command line interface and a GTK based GUI
bundled in [SpeedDate.jl](https://github.com/Ward9250/SpeedDate.jl). There is
also a notebook hosted using the [Binder](http://mybinder.org/)
system planned, where you can use a notebook to use the SpeedDate method right
away, no need to install anything new on your computer.

## Installing SpeedDate to your machine

First you should have [julia installed](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia).

Open a julia terminal and enter:

Enter in a Julia terminal:
```julia
Pkg.add("https://github.com/Ward9250/SpeedDate.jl.git")
```
To download and install the master branch.

julia might ask you to do the `Pkg.update()` command before or after installing
packages, and this is perfectly normal and fine to do.
